## Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project
### Overview
This project uses the Twitter API to collect tweets related to a specific keyword and analyzes the sentiment of the tweets using a BERT model. The keyword can be easily changed to analyze sentiment for different topics. The results of the analysis include a report of the percentage of tweets with positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, as well as a word cloud visualization.

### Installation

### Usage
* Modify the keyword in the twitter_sentiment.ipynb file line: 
    tweets= get_tweets('The Watcher',language='en',num_tweets=1000). In this case, the default keyword is "The Watcher" for analyzing sentiment related to the mini-series.
